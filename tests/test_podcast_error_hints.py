"""Hints attached to podcast generation failures (#1238).

The GPT-5 extended-thinking hint used to be the only one, keyed on
`Invalid json output` / `Expecting value`. The two most common real failures
therefore got either nothing (`Invalid speaker name`) or advice about the wrong
provider - a truncated Gemini response was told to switch to gpt-4o.
