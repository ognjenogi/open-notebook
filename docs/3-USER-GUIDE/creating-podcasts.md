# Creating Podcasts - Turn Research into Audio

Generate an audio episode from your sources and notes. How generation works, and what each setting means, is explained in [Podcasts Explained](../2-CORE-CONCEPTS/podcasts-explained.md).

Podcasts live on the **Podcasts** page (sidebar, under **Create**), which has two tabs: **Episodes** and **Profiles**.

## Before Your First Episode: Set Up Profiles

You need at least one **speaker profile** with a voice model and one **episode profile** with an outline and transcript model.

Open **Podcasts → Profiles**. A new install already has three speaker profiles and three episode profiles, but **none of them has models assigned**; they show a **Setup required** badge (upgraded installations may already have models on them). Either edit them or create your own. Create speakers first: episode profiles reference a speaker profile.

You'll need these models added in **Manage → Models** (**Sync Models** → **Discover Models** on a provider configuration); you then select them in the profile fields below:
- a **text-to-speech** model (for voices). Which providers offer TTS is listed in [AI Providers](../4-AI-PROVIDERS/index.md); for a local option see [Local TTS](../5-CONFIGURATION/local-tts.md).
- a **language** model for the outline and transcript.

### Speaker profile

Click **Create speaker** (or **Edit** on an existing one) and fill in:

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Profile name**, **Description** | For you |
| **Voice model** | Required. The TTS model all speakers use by default |
| **Speakers** | One to four. **Add speaker** for more |
| → **Name** | The name used in the script |
| → **Voice ID** | A voice name of the voice model, typed exactly (for example `nova` for OpenAI). Check your TTS provider's voice list |
| → **Backstory**, **Personality** | Who they are and how they talk; the transcript model uses both |
| → **Per-speaker TTS override (optional)** | A different voice model for this speaker, or **Use profile default** |

The seeded profiles use OpenAI voice names (`nova`, `alloy`, ...). If your voice model is from another provider, change the Voice IDs, or generation fails with a voice error.

### Episode profile

Click **Create profile** (or **Edit**) and fill in:

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Profile name**, **Description** | For you |
| **Speaker profile** | Which speakers to use |
| **Outline model**, **Transcript model** | Language models; they can be the same |
| **Segments** | 3 to 20. More segments make a longer episode |
| **Default briefing** | Required. Structure, tone, audience and goals for this format, in plain words. This is where "keep it casual", "aimed at beginners" or "end with open questions" goes |
| **Language** | Optional. The language of the outline and transcript (for example Portuguese (Brazil)). Pick voices that can speak it |
| **Max output tokens** | Optional cap on each generation step (outline, transcript). Blank uses 8192. Set it lower only if your model's output limit is below 8192 |

Profiles can also be **Duplicated** and **Deleted**. A speaker profile that an episode profile uses can't be deleted until you change that episode profile.

## Generate an Episode

1. Click **Generate Podcast** on the **Episodes** tab (or use sidebar **New → Podcast**, or **New Podcast** in Quick actions).
2. In **Generate Podcast Episode**, under **Content**, pick what to include. Expand a notebook and select it as a whole, or individual sources and notes. For each source choose:
   - **Summary**: the source's title and insights (small; a source without insights adds almost nothing).
   - **Full content**: title, insights and full text.

   The dialog shows the number of selected items and an estimated token and character count. You can mix content from several notebooks.
3. Under **Episode Settings**:
   - **Episode profile**: required.
   - **Episode name**: required.
   - **Additional instructions**: optional; appended to the profile's briefing for this episode only (for example "focus on the methodology section").
4. Click **Generate**. You'll see *Podcast task started*.

Generation runs in the background worker, so you can close the page. It takes several minutes, depending on the amount of content, the number of segments and your providers. If episodes stay pending, the worker isn't running.

## Episodes

The **Episodes** tab groups episodes into **Currently Processing**, **Queued / Pending**, **Completed Episodes** and **Failed Episodes**, with totals at the top.

Each episode card has:
- an **audio player** (completed episodes),
- **Details**, with the episode's **Summary** (profiles and models used), **Outline** and **Transcript**,
- **Delete** (removes the episode and its audio file),
- **Retry** (failed episodes): deletes the failed episode and submits a new job with the same name, content, episode profile and speaker profile, using the profiles' current settings (so you can fix a profile, then retry). The episode's **Additional instructions** are not kept.

Failed episodes show the error. Common errors and fixes are listed in [Podcasts Explained → When Things Go Wrong](../2-CORE-CONCEPTS/podcasts-explained.md#when-things-go-wrong-failures--retry).

## Tips for Better Episodes

- **Select less content.** The outline and transcript models read everything you select, every time. *Summary* for background sources and *Full content* for the main ones keeps cost down and focus up.
- **Put the direction in the briefing.** Tone, audience, structure and what to emphasize all come from the default briefing plus the additional instructions; the more concrete, the better.
- **Give speakers distinct personalities and voices.** Two speakers with the same voice and similar personalities are hard to follow.
- **Retry once on odd failures.** Some failures (such as *Invalid speaker name*) come from a single bad model response and succeed on retry.
- **Cost** is the outline and transcript language-model calls (which include all selected content) plus text-to-speech for the full script. Check your providers' pricing.
