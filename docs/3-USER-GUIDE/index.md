# User Guide - How to Use Open Notebook

Step-by-step instructions for each feature. If you want to understand how things work first (notebooks, sources, insights, context levels), read [Core Concepts](../2-CORE-CONCEPTS/index.md).

---

## Before You Start

Open Notebook needs at least one AI provider and default models. Follow [AI Providers → Connect a provider](../4-AI-PROVIDERS/index.md#connect-a-provider) to add a provider in **Manage → Models**, add its models and set the **Default Model Assignments**. [API Configuration](api-configuration.md) covers the rest of the Models page.

What each feature needs:

| Feature | Models needed |
|---------|---------------|
| Notebook chat, source chat | Chat Model |
| Transformations (insights) | Transformation Model, or the Chat Model if none is set |
| Ask | Chat Model and Embedding Model |
| Vector search | Embedding Model |
| Text search | None |
| Uploaded audio and video files, YouTube videos without a transcript | Speech-to-Text Model (YouTube videos with a transcript don't need one) |
| Podcasts | The language and text-to-speech models chosen in the episode and speaker profiles |

## Your First 15 Minutes

1. **Create a notebook.** Sidebar **New → Notebook** (or **Notebooks → New Notebook**). Give it a name and a short description; the description is sent to the AI in notebook Chat.
2. **Add a source.** In the notebook, **Add Source → Add Source**, then choose **Add URL**, **Upload File** or **Enter Text**. On the Process step, keep the pre-selected transformation and embedding, and click **Done**. Processing runs in the background; the card shows **Queued**, **Processing**, then **Completed**. See [Adding Sources](adding-sources.md).
3. **Chat.** In the Chat column, type a question and press **Ctrl+Enter** (**⌘+Enter** on Mac). Click a numbered reference in the answer to open what it cites.
4. **Keep the answer.** Click the **Save to note** icon under the answer. It appears in the Notes column.
5. **Ask across everything.** Open **Ask and Search**, stay on **Ask (beta)**, type a question and click **Ask**. Save the answer with **Save to Notebooks**.
