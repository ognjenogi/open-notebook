# Database - SurrealDB Configuration

Open Notebook stores everything except uploaded files and podcast audio in [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com). The API and the background worker both connect to it with the same five variables. Schema migrations run automatically when the API starts.

---

## Connection settings

```env
SURREAL_URL=ws://surrealdb:8000/rpc
SURREAL_USER=root
SURREAL_PASSWORD=root
SURREAL_NAMESPACE=open_notebook
SURREAL_DATABASE=open_notebook
```

Set all five explicitly. The API and the job queue fall back to different defaults when a variable is missing (`open_notebook` versus `test` for namespace and database), and with mismatched values background jobs never get processed. Defaults and legacy names are in the [Environment Reference](environment-reference.md#database-surrealdb).

`SURREAL_USER` and `SURREAL_PASSWORD` must match the `--user` and `--pass` that SurrealDB was started with.

---

## Which `SURREAL_URL` to use

The host in `SURREAL_URL` is the database as seen **from wherever the API and worker run**.

| Open Notebook | SurrealDB | `SURREAL_URL` |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| Docker Compose (shipped file) | `surrealdb` service in the same compose file | `ws://surrealdb:8000/rpc` |
| Docker | On the host machine | `ws://host.docker.internal:8000/rpc` (on Linux, add `extra_hosts: ["host.docker.internal:host-gateway"]` to the service) |
| From source | Docker (`make database`) or installed locally | `ws://localhost:8000/rpc` |
| Single-container image | Inside the same container | `ws://localhost:8000/rpc` (see [Single Container](../1-INSTALLATION/single-container.md)) |
| Anywhere | Another machine | `ws://<db-host>:8000/rpc` |

`localhost` inside a container is the container itself, not your machine. Using `ws://localhost:8000/rpc` in the compose setup is the most common reason the API won't start.

The shipped compose file publishes SurrealDB on `127.0.0.1:8000` only, so other machines can't reach it. To connect from elsewhere, re-publish the port deliberately (see `docker-compose.override.yml.example` in the repository root), with real credentials and a firewall or SSH tunnel.

---

## Changing the credentials

With the shipped compose file, put the new values in a `.env` file next to `docker-compose.yml`:

```env
SURREAL_USER=<your-db-user>
SURREAL_PASSWORD=<generated-password>
```

Generate the password yourself, for example with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Don't reuse an example value.

The compose file passes them to both the `surrealdb` command and the `open_notebook` environment, so they stay in sync. Apply with `docker compose up -d`.

---

## Several instances on one SurrealDB

A SurrealDB server can hold many namespaces, and each namespace many databases. To run several independent Open Notebook instances against one server, give each instance its own `SURREAL_NAMESPACE` or `SURREAL_DATABASE`.

---

## When the API can't reach the database

While waiting for SurrealDB, the API logs `Database is not reachable yet (attempt n/12)` and retries. After the last attempt it logs `Database did not become reachable after 12 attempts` and `CRITICAL: Database migration failed`, and the API doesn't start, so the browser can't reach it (**Unable to Connect to API Server**, or the UI doesn't load at all in the Docker image, where the UI waits for the API). If the database goes away later, while the API is running, the UI shows **Database Connection Failed**. See [Connection Issues → Database Connection Failed](../6-TROUBLESHOOTING/connection-issues.md#database-connection-failed).
