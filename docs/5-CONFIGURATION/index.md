# Configuration

Open Notebook is configured in two places:

1. **Environment variables** for infrastructure: the encryption key, the database connection, the API URL, timeouts. The complete list is the [Environment Reference](environment-reference.md).
2. **The web UI** for everything else: AI provider credentials and models in **Manage → Models**, content processing engines in **Settings**.

## Where environment variables go

### Docker Compose

Put them under the `open_notebook` service's `environment:` block in `docker-compose.yml`, then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

`docker compose restart` keeps the old environment, so it does not apply changes.

```yaml
services:
  open_notebook:
    environment:
      - OPEN_NOTEBOOK_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<generated-key>
      - API_URL=https://notebook.example.com
```

Replace `<generated-key>` with a value you generate yourself, for example with `openssl rand -hex 32` (on Windows, see [Set your encryption key](../1-INSTALLATION/docker-compose.md#step-2-set-your-encryption-key)). Don't reuse an example value.

The shipped `docker-compose.yml` doesn't load an env file into the container. A `.env` file next to it only fills the `${...}` placeholders in the compose file (`SURREAL_USER`, `SURREAL_PASSWORD`), so a variable that exists only in `.env` never reaches Open Notebook. To keep settings in a file, add `env_file: .env` to the `open_notebook` service.

### From source

Put backend variables in `.env` in the project root (start from `.env.example`) and restart the API and the worker (`make api` and `make worker-start` load it). The exception is `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_WORKER_MAX_TASKS`, which `make worker-start` reads from your shell: `export` it first.

Frontend variables (`API_URL`, `INTERNAL_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`) are not read from the root `.env`; see [Environment Reference → How to set a variable](environment-reference.md#how-to-set-a-variable).

## The settings that matter

### Encryption key (required)

```yaml
- OPEN_NOTEBOOK_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<generated-key>
```

Encrypts the provider API keys you save in Manage → Models. Generate the value yourself, for example with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Without it you can't save credentials. Replace the `change-me-to-a-secret-string` placeholder from the shipped file, and don't change the value later: credentials saved with the old key become unreadable. See [Security](security.md#api-key-encryption).

### Database

```yaml
- SURREAL_URL=ws://surrealdb:8000/rpc
- SURREAL_USER=root
- SURREAL_PASSWORD=root
- SURREAL_NAMESPACE=open_notebook
- SURREAL_DATABASE=open_notebook
```

The shipped compose file already sets these. The hostname in `SURREAL_URL` depends on where SurrealDB runs; see [Database](database.md). Change the user and password before exposing the instance (set `SURREAL_USER`/`SURREAL_PASSWORD` in `.env`; the compose file applies them to both services).

### AI providers (in the UI)

Providers are connected in **Manage → Models**: add a configuration, test it, add models and set the default models. Follow [Connect a provider](../4-AI-PROVIDERS/index.md#connect-a-provider) for the steps.

Details for each provider: [AI Providers](ai-providers.md). Local options: [Ollama](ollama.md), [oMLX](omlx.md), [OpenAI-Compatible](openai-compatible.md) (LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp…), [Local speech with Speaches](local-tts.md).

### API URL (usually not needed)

The browser finds the API automatically at `<the host you opened>:5055`. Set `API_URL` only when that's wrong: behind a reverse proxy (`API_URL=https://notebook.example.com`) or when the API is published on another port. See [Reverse Proxy](reverse-proxy.md#how-the-browser-finds-the-api).

### Password

Set `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD` for anything reachable beyond your own machine. Without it, authentication is off. See [Security](security.md).

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Variable added to `.env` only (Docker) | Setting has no effect | Put it under `open_notebook` → `environment:` |
| `docker compose restart` after editing | Old values still used | `docker compose up -d` |
| No encryption key | "Encryption key not configured" in **Manage → Models** | Set `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_ENCRYPTION_KEY` |
| Encryption key changed | "Decryption Error" on saved credentials | Restore the old key, or delete and re-create the credentials |
| No default chat model | Chat fails with "No model configured for default for type=chat" | Manage → Models → Default Model Assignments |
| Port 5055 not reachable from the browser | "Unable to Connect to API Server" | Publish 5055, or set `API_URL` behind a proxy |
| `SURREAL_URL` uses `localhost` inside Docker | API won't start, "Database is not reachable yet" in the log | Use the service name: `ws://surrealdb:8000/rpc` |
