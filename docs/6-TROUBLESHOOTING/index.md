## First checks

```bash
docker compose ps                                  # surrealdb and open_notebook both Up?
curl -s http://localhost:5055/health               # {"status":"healthy"}
curl -s http://localhost:5055/api/config           # "dbStatus": "online"
docker compose logs --since 10m open_notebook | grep -iE "error|warning|critical"
docker compose exec open_notebook sh -c 'printenv | cut -d= -f1 | grep -E "OPEN_NOTEBOOK|SURREAL|API_URL|ESPERANTO"'   # names only
```

When you share output in an issue or a chat, never include the values of `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD` or `SURREAL_PASSWORD`.

Settings belong under the `open_notebook` service's `environment:` block and take effect with `docker compose up -d`; `docker compose restart` keeps the old environment, and a variable that is only in `.env` doesn't reach the container. All variables: [Environment Reference](../5-CONFIGURATION/environment-reference.md).
